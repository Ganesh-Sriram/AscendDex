# AscendDex

AscendDex is an advanced computer vision project dedicated to monitoring and analyzing the movement of individuals across vertical spaces, particularly on escalators. Using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms like YOLO, AscendDex accurately detects and tracks people as they ascend and descend on escalators, providing precise analytics of vertical traffic flow.

## Features

- **Escalator Traffic Monitoring:** AscendDex precisely tracks the movement of individuals on escalators, offering real-time analysis of vertical traffic.
- **Accurate Person Counting:** Leveraging computer vision algorithms, it accurately counts and monitors people, ensuring precise analysis of vertical pedestrian flow.
- **Customizable Settings:** Users can configure settings to adapt to different escalator setups, enabling versatile monitoring options.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Computer Vision libraries (OpenCV, YOLO, etc.)
- Camera Input or Live CCTV footage or Video source

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure the source (camera input or CCTV or video) in the main script.
4. Run the main script using `python ascenddex.py`.

## Usage

1. Open the AscendDex python script.
2. Define the escalator area for monitoring using masks.
3. Access real-time data and analysis of vertical traffic on the dashboard.
